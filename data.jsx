        desc1: `Your vehicle’s axle, CV joint, and driveshaft components are integral to the performance and drivability of your vehicle. The driveshaft is a steel or aluminum cylindrical component that connects the transmission to the rear differential. The driveshaft connects to the transmission through the CV joints, which are responsible for transferring the torque from the transmission to the drive wheels at a constant speed. Front wheel drive vehicles use CV joints on the front axles. CV joints allow the axle to bend and change while accommodating the bounce of the wheels. The axle bears the weight of the vehicle while also being strong enough to sustain the forces from braking and accelerating. Over time and through normal use, your vehicle’s axle, CV joint, and driveshaft components may require maintenance or replacement services.`,

Clunking or clicking noises are signs that a CV joint needs replacement. Vibrations during acceleration may indicate a damaged driveshaft, though they may also point to an axle issue depending on the layout of your vehicle. Turning and steering issues may also arise out of a problem with the driveshaft. CV joints can go bad when the grease leaks out of a damaged CV boot. There are various determinants for how quickly your vehicle’s axle, CV joint, and driveshaft components will degrade over time.

The inner CV joint connects the transmission to the axle, and the outer joint connects the axle to the wheels. As the vehicle experiences road force, the CV joints move in conjunction with the suspension system while helping the wheels maintain a constant velocity. A CV boot houses a CV joint and protects it by keeping out dirt, debris, and other elements. CV boots are made of rubber or plastic strong enough to withstand the constant bending of the CV joints. The boots also ensure that the CV joints remain lubricated by encapsulating the required amount of lithium moly grease. Without proper lubrication, a CV joint cannot easily adjust to the motion of the wheels. CV boots naturally degrade with age. Inspections can prolong the life of CV joints and prevent costly future repairs or replacements.`,

On older vehicles, u-joints will rust, adding surface resistance onto the joints, making them less able to turn as they once did. Routine inspections of your u-joints have been known to prevent more expensive repairs. Replacing your u-joints at the first sign of trouble will also help prevent failure in your vehicle’s driveline. When you need new u-joints, give us a call.`,

In most configurations, one yoke connects to the rear of the vehicle while the other yoke reaches into the transmission. The driveshaft sends power from the transmission and turns the differential, which moves the wheels. These connecting components help transfer your vehicle’s rotational energy from the transmission to the moving wheels. Many driveshafts are designed with a slip yoke at one end and an end yoke at the other end. The slip yoke allows for the length of the driveshaft to change with the motion of the suspension system as it reacts to the forces of the road. At the same time, the u-joints allow for changes in angle between the differential and the transmission. These components are designed to be flexible in order to maintain constant speeds and rotational forces between elements of your vehicle’s axle assembly.`,

Running engines produce a tremendous amount of heat that will need to be transferred away from the engine in order to prevent overheating and subsequent breakdowns. Heater hoses are responsible for carrying coolant to prevent overheating. Coolant or antifreeze flows through the engine, absorbs the excess heat, and carries the heat away from the engine. More specifically, heater hoses are responsible for transferring coolant away from the engine to the heater core, where the warm air can be blown inside the compartment of your vehicle by engaging the adjacent fan. Heater fans blow through the heater core to heat the vehicle and cool the antifreeze inside of it. The hoses transfer the coolant back into the path of the cooling system at a lower temperature so the coolant can continue to regulate consistent temperatures inside the engine.`,

Radiator hoses carry hot coolant away from the engine and into the radiator, a large tank with small channels where the coolant flows to dissipate heat. Radiator fans, which are located behind the radiator, help cool the antifreeze or coolant once it enters. The radiator hoses also carry the coolant back into the engine to absorb the heat created during the combustion process. Once the engine reaches operating temperatures, the hot coolant cycles back to the radiator where it is cooled again. Because the engine can reach extreme temperatures, the coolant is often extremely hot. Over time, hot coolant can cause radiator hoses to deteriorate from the inside out.`,

When the crankshaft turns, the timing belt turns the camshaft, which opens and closes the engine valves to allow the pistons to move up and down. Your vehicle’s engine operates in four phases: intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust. During the intake phase, intake valves open and exhaust valves close as fuel and air enter the cylinders. As the air and fuel is mixed, compressed, and ignited by spark plugs during the compression and combustion phases, the valves close. The remaining air and fuel is pushed out of the exhaust valve during the exhaust phase.

As a result, inspecting these components and ensuring proper operation has become a critical part of overall vehicle maintenance. Although brake systems vary from vehicle to vehicle, the responsibility and importance of the components remains the same. Today, some common brake types include drum and disc brakes. Drum brakes contain brake shoes, drums, wheel cylinders, springs, and self-adjusters. Disc brakes contain brake pads, rotors, calipers, and hydraulic components. Depending on the design of the rear brake system, the parking brake assembly, which keeps the vehicle from rolling once stopped, can be housed in either a drum or rotor. All of these components, including the brake pedal and brake fluid, should be checked during a brake inspection service to help ensure that a vehicle is safe to operate.`,

The goal of our brake inspection is to find, diagnose, and discuss any issues while recommending brake repair procedures. During a brake inspection, we may discover that your brake system requires new brake pads or shoes, or the installation of new brake calipers or wheel cylinders. Alternatively, we may need to drain and replace your old brake fluid to rid the brake lines of air, dirt, and other contaminants. If your brake lines and hoses show cracks or heat damage, we may suggest replacements. To restore maximum braking ability, the rotors or drums of your disc or drum brake system might also need to be replaced.

Commonly made of cast iron, rotors are discs that mount to the wheel hub. When you press the brake pedal, the brake pads compress against the rotors and slow your wheels. Rotor design may vary from vehicle to vehicle and from brake system to brake system. Variations in design help dissipate the heat created between the brake pads and the rotors when you slow your vehicle. Disc brake systems can account for heat dissipation in two ways: either the rotors will have a ventilated design, or the brake pads will contain a slot on the surface. These vents and slots provide passages so air circulation can effectively cool the rotor. Proper heat dissipation is extremely important for prolonging the life of your rotors. Drivers are encouraged to watch their brake rotors and seek rotor repairs or rotor replacements when necessary.`,

As brake pads compress against the rotor to stop the vehicle, the friction required to slow your wheels creates a large amount of heat that, if not properly dissipated, can wear down your brake pads and rotors. A vibrating brake pedal is one indication that your rotors are damaged and need to be replaced. When a rotor is removed from the brake assembly, the rotor will be inspected for cracks and other damage incurred during routine operation. Periodic inspections of rotors will prolong rotor repairs and replacements while ensuring your brake system continues operating as expected.

In a disc brake system, the rotor is mounted to the wheel hub, and calipers are responsible for squeezing the brake pads against the disc in order to slow the speed of the turning rotor and bring the vehicle to a complete stop. Because front disc brake systems convert kinetic energy into heat, ventilation slots, holes, or vanes are necessary for expelling heat from the brake system. While the brake pads are already designed to withstand heat, excessive amounts of heat are still damaging to the pads as well as other disc brake components. Brake systems that use disc brakes are known to possess strong stopping power. Like all brake systems, however, disc brakes will wear over time.

When deciding whether or not to schedule a front disc brake repair service, there are some symptoms to consider. Squealing noises from the front brakes point to worn brake pads, while grinding noises are a sure sign that your rotors need servicing. If your brake pedal shakes when engaged, this may also be a sign of bad rotors. A vehicle that pulls to one side when braking indicates a bad caliper or uneven brake pad wear, which can result from uneven distribution of pressure in the brake lines. Besides incurring additional repair costs, leaving symptoms of an impending front disc brake repair untreated can lead to serious, stressful situations for both yourself and other drivers on the road.`,

Most motorists use the parking brake when parking on a steep hill. However, the parking brake can also be used to stop suddenly and prevent an accident from occurring. There are three types of parking brakes that use a ratchet locking mechanism: stick, center level, and pedal. Each type of parking brake depends on the style of driver’s seat, and each operates differently depending on the brake system.

Routine rear disc brake inspections can prevent excessive wear from damaging other brake components like calipers and rotors. Completely worn brake pads can cause calipers to squeeze metal on metal, which will damage the rotors. Some disc brake pads have a wear indicator strip that makes a whistling sound to notify you when brake pads need replacements. Sometimes the calipers can stick and keep from retracting all the way, which can cause quicker wear on brake pads.

Drum brake components consist of brake drums, shoes, wheel cylinders, and hardware including springs and self-adjusters. The brake shoes sit against the drum until the brakes are applied. Once applied, brake fluid pushes the wheel cylinders against the brake shoes, which in turn press against the brake drum and create the friction required to stop your vehicle. When you let off the brakes, the springs return the brake shoes back to their original position. This self-adjusting system helps keep the brake shoes in position when the brakes are not applied. As the brake shoes gradually become worn, the self-adjuster compensates for the worn area by adjusting the original position of the brake shoe so that it is closer to the brake drum. Because rear drum brakes serve an important role in slowing your vehicle, it is wise to get them repaired and replaced as necessary.`,

As the refrigerant flows through the air conditioning system, it is turned from a hot gas into a liquid, which is then cooled, turned into a gas again, and vaporized in order to absorb heat from the cabin. At the end of the cycle, the cool air is blown into the cabin. This process is made possible by the drive belt, which drives the compressor, the main component of the air conditioning system. The compressor works in concert with the condenser, evaporator, and other parts. If any of these components cease to operate efficiently, the functionality of the entire system is at risk.

            desc1: `Car air conditioning systems promote a comfortable cabin interior and help prevent driver fatigue. During normal vehicle operation, a substantial amount of heat is created by the engine and exterior contributors like the road and sun. Your vehicle’s AC system is responsible for cooling, purifying, and circulating air. Your air conditioning system works through a series of processes that involve refrigerant. In your vehicle, the refrigerant is responsible for removing heat from the cabin compartment. Refrigerant goes through a continuous cycle of air compression that is dependent on your compressor’s drive belt. The compressor pumps the refrigerant through the system where it is transformed from a hot gas into a liquid and then cooled. Through a number of other components, such as the condenser, compressor, and evaporator, the liquid is again processed into a gas, pressurized, and vaporized before being released into the cabin as cool air.`,

            desc1: `Like most aspects of car maintenance, treating a problem with your vehicle’s air conditioning system early can help prevent major repairs. For example, an air conditioning system operating on low refrigerant due to a leak will eventually damage the compressor. Replacing or repairing the compressor can be more expensive than sealing the leak and refilling the refrigerant. Some symptoms to beware of regarding a faulty air conditioning system include an inoperative fan or blower, an unusual amount of noise during regular operation, and, of course, reduced cooling capability. Stale smelling air is another sign that something is wrong with your vehicle’s air conditioner. A clogged compressor, evaporator, condenser, or expansion valve can contribute to AC system failure. Routine maintenance now can help you avoid major AC repairs down the road.`,

Your vehicle’s cooling system is responsible for reducing the temperature inside your engine and preventing possible overheating. Excess heat can build in a variety of places in your vehicle’s engine. When the engine reaches maximum operating temperatures, the thermostat opens and releases antifreeze from the engine to the radiator, which initiates the circulatory flow to absorb excess heat. The antifreeze is also responsible for keeping other engine fluids from boiling or freezing. After the antifreeze flows through the engine, it cycles back to the radiator, where the excess heat escapes through the radiator’s walls. The antifreeze is cooled by the cooling fan and readied to be re-released into the engine to dissipate additional heat.`,

Generally, symbols are universal or very similar in appearance across different makes and models of vehicles. If you are unfamiliar with the symbol, you can consult your owners manual for its meaning. In many modern vehicles, dashboard warnings are color-coded. Yellow, orange, and red generally tell motorists to seek service shortly. When the text or symbol flashes, drivers should seek service immediately. Green and blue alerts also exist, and these are intended as informational pop-ups meant to inform you that something is in operation. Dashboard indicator lights exist for oil, tire pressure, lights, brakes, and more.`,

Bulbs are primarily composed of glass, a low pressure inert gas, a filament, and wires. Using the electricity provided by a vehicle’s charging system, bulbs produce a strong, steady light. A motorist can alter the bulb’s level of brightness to a low or high beam setting. Motorists tend to use low beams at night or during periods of inclement weather. In contrast, drivers generally use high beams at night when it is especially dark and other sources of lights are unavailable. When bulbs produce light at the high beam setting they can also cause glare, so drivers should be careful when using high beams around others. Some higher quality bulbs will function at optimal levels for several years. All headlight bulbs will eventually require replacement as their filaments fail from use over time.`,

            desc1: `The timing belt, or timing chain in some vehicles, is a drive belt that synchronizes the rotation of the engine’s crankshaft and camshaft with the opening and closing of your engine’s valves. Depending on the vehicle, it may also rotate the water pump. When the crankshaft turns, the timing belt turns the camshaft, which opens and closes the engine valves to allow the pistons to move up and down. Your vehicle’s engine operates in four phases: intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust. During the intake phase, intake valves open and exhaust valves close as fuel and air enter the cylinders. As the air and fuel is mixed, compressed, and ignited by spark plugs during the compression and combustion phases, the valves close. The remaining air and fuel is pushed out of the exhaust valve during the exhaust phase. The timing belt is responsible for synchronizing this process and for opening and closing valves during normal engine operation.`,

            desc1: `Avoiding a timing belt replacement can result in complete engine failure. A worn or stretched belt can disrupt the operating order of the valves and pistons, which can result in a piston hitting a valve and damaging the engine. Timing belt failure warning signs include rough idling or difficulty starting the engine. Cracks on the belt, which is made of reinforced rubber, are an indication that it may soon break. Replacement of your timing belt will help keep your engine performing as it should and ensure you avoid expensive future repairs. During our replacement service, your belt will be replaced and synchronized with the crankshaft and camshaft to restore proper operating precision and order. It is widely recommended that you have your water pump changed during a timing belt replacement service as well. If your water pump fails later, it can do great damage to your vehicle. Since the water pump is easy to change during a timing belt replacement, consider having a new one installed at this time. Referring to your owner’s manual will help determine the appropriate service intervals for timing belt maintenance.`,

Engine diagnostics allow our staff to gather helpful information about the operating condition of your engine. The insights obtained during an engine diagnostic will determine the extent of suggested engine repairs. The most common diagnostic trouble codes are generated in response to malfunctions in the powertrain. Ultimately, regular engine tune-ups are necessary to optimize engine performance. A tune-up is also one of the most effective ways to prevent unexpected engine trouble. During an engine tune-up, our staff may replace the spark plugs, spark plug wires, air filter, fuel filter, and distributor cap and rotor in your vehicle. Our experts will also check emission levels, fuel lines, and belts and hoses.

Both OBD I and OBD II systems exist, with OBD II systems becoming the standard in vehicles manufactured after 1996. The OBD is connected to the engine control unit (ECU), which helps your engine run efficiently while keeping emissions low. The OBD can identify and warn the driver of engine malfunction by sending error notifications to the ECU system. The ECU is in charge of several engine processes, including the mixture of air and fuel, emissions, and engine timing. The ECU uses sensors to monitor them or make adjustments. If the ECU detects malfunctions, it triggers the “check engine” light on the dashboard. The OBD system then records the code pertaining to the problem. The code can be accessed by a trained technician through engine diagnostic equipment in order to properly diagnose the issue.`,

The exhaust system is composed of pipes and tubing designed to streamline vehicle operation while maximizing vehicle performance and efficiency. Engines produce dangerous gases as a byproduct of the combustion process. The exhaust manifold collects the emissions from the engine and funnels the gases through the front pipe to the catalytic converter. The converter transforms these harmful gases, like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxide, into less harmful ones, like oxygen, nitrogen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. The muffler helps cancel out the noise created by the engine. The muffler dissipates sound waves while the tailpipe releases the converted gases into the atmosphere.`,

Catalytic converters contain honeycomb-like structures coated with platinum and palladium that help minimize the harmful effects of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxide produced by your vehicle’s engine. These harmful elements pass through two stages: the reduction catalyst stage and the oxidation catalyst stage. During the reduction catalyst stage, nitrogen oxide is converted into oxygen and nitrogen gases while carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon is oxidized in the oxidation catalyst stage. The catalytic converter also relies on the oxygen sensor to detect the correct level of oxygen introduced in the oxidation catalyst stage. Routine exhaust system maintenance can help ensure your catalytic converter is always working optimally and reduce the likelihood of it releasing harmful and often deadly chemicals into the environment, or into the cabin of your vehicle.`,

Consider scheduling an inspection of your manifold at the first sign of trouble. If leaks or damage are detected during a service, your manifold will be replaced. Routine inspections of your vehicle’s exhaust system can prevent your manifold from failing and potentially allowing harmful fumes to reach you and your passengers.`,

            desc1: `As part of the exhaust system, the muffler is responsible for dampening engine noise and releasing vehicle emissions into the environment. All mufflers are designed to revert the pressure and emissions produced in the combustion process and keep them from entering the cabin of the vehicle. Mufflers are commonly made of steel and coated with aluminum. There are two types of mufflers in vehicles. The first type of muffler utilizes resonating and expansion chambers to reduce noises as a result of the engine combustion process. When sound waves move through this type of muffler, high frequency waves collide with low frequency waves and cancel each other out, thereby eliminating noise. The other type of muffler utilizes a perforated pipe, containing metal, fiberglass, or another sound-absorbing material. Maintaining optimal muffler performance is a must if you aim to protect your passengers from harmful emissions while keeping the operation of your vehicle relatively quiet.`,

            desc1: `Like most vehicle components, routine visual inspections can promote proper muffler maintenance, but there are signs to be aware of when considering the likelihood of a muffler replacement. Sometimes muffler repair may be necessary to replace a broken clamp or clasp, but over time, through periods of heavy use, mufflers may rust and rot. Other times, a muffler may be damaged by road debris. Vibrations coming from the muffler are a sign of loose hanger mounts. Vibrations may also indicate that the sound-reducing parts have corroded and stopped working completely. Soot-covered mufflers and loud noises are sure signs of a bad muffler. A bad muffler can lead to decreased fuel efficiency and rough idling. Large clouds of smoke coming from the exhaust pipe is cause for having your muffler inspected or replaced. Our service staff can restore efficiency to your vehicle’s exhaust system by replacing a faulty muffler.`,

Drivers depend on four wheel drive systems to give them better traction on snow, ice, and off-road terrain. Vehicles with 4WD can be full-time or part-time. A part time 4WD system can be engaged and disengaged as desired by the driver and is designed to be used under conditions where poor traction is an issue. Standard full-time 4WD systems consistently deliver power to all four wheels, and can be operated while driving on any type of surface. The goal of a 4WD system is to send torque to the wheels to prevent slippage. A four wheel drive system is composed of various parts. These include the differentials, hubs, and the transfer case. A transfer case is responsible for delivering power to both the front and rear axles, while hubs help secure the wheels. To keep a 4WD vehicle performing as intended, drivers should watch over the different parts of the system and have them routinely inspected during a 4WD service.`,

            desc1: `Motor oil and lube changes are very important for keeping your engine functioning properly. Motor oil keeps your engine lubricated so there isn’t any excess friction or wear on moving parts. Oil cools down your engine, fights rust and corrosion, reduces engine noise, and works with the oil filter to remove contaminants from the engine. Oil is very important to your engine for helping it operate at optimum performance levels. When you drive your car, your engine becomes very hot, and heat makes oil break down. Broken down oil doesn’t move through your engine as well, which means the oil cannot do its job. Oil also cleans your engine as it flows around it. Dirty oil moves more slowly than clean oil and is not able to lubricate your engine correctly. In addition, the gritty particles in dirty oil can hinder its friction reduction abilities and increase wear on moving parts.`,

        desc1: `Preventive maintenance is the care and protection of your vehicle against potential major auto repairs. Negligence is the most common and costly way to see money wasted on repairs that could have easily been prevented through regular service intervals. Depending on your vehicle’s manufacturer, avoiding preventive maintenance on certain parts and components has the potential to void warranty coverage. Car maintenance intervals have been designed to improve the reliability, durability, and resale value of your vehicle. Based upon your driving conditions, these service intervals may arrive sooner than you expect. For example, short commutes can actually hurt a vehicle because most engines thrive during long drives. Driving short commutes, experiencing stop-and-go traffic, and carrying heavy cargo are all aspects of severe driving. However, severe driving can also be reinforced by your environment. Hot or cold weather, mountainous or rough roads, and dusty or salty environments can all affect your vehicle. Because of these innumerable factors, adhering to a rigid service schedule can keep your vehicle operating at maximum efficiency for years to come.`,

Playing a defensive role, air filters prevent dirt particles, bugs, and other contaminants from entering the engine and causing destruction. Unfortunately, engine air filters lose effectiveness over time and require replacements. Drivers looking to replace an air filter can choose from three common types: paper, foam, and cotton. Paper air filters are usually cheap, but they generally wear out faster than their counterparts. Foam filters are a popular choice for off-road vehicles, because they have strong filtering capabilities. However, they also tend to clog engines if used and left unchecked. Cotton filters are commonly found on race cars, but can be also used as aftermarket upgrades on everyday vehicles. No matter the type of air filter in your vehicle, it is important to replace the air filter as needed. A dirty air filter can negatively affect gas mileage and make an engine run roughly.`,

            desc1: `During a fuel injection, your vehicle’s fuel injectors are checked. Located in the intake manifold of the engine, fuel injectors use small nozzles to spray a mist of fuel that your engine can burn. Fuel injectors work with your throttle valve, which lets air into the engine whenever you use the gas pedal. When the valve opens, fuel injectors release the fuel mist so it mixes with the air. This fuel and air combination then enters the combustion chamber and helps your vehicle run. Over time, fuel injectors can become dirty. Clogged injectors can negatively affect your vehicle’s performance, leading to poor gas mileage and dirty exhaust emissions. Short trips make it especially easy for dirt and grime to build up inside the fuel injector nozzles. Because a healthy fuel injection system is important for overall vehicle maintenance, we advise you to keep watch over your fuel injectors and have them serviced as needed.`,

Oil plays an essential role in the engine of your vehicle, where it helps alleviate friction between various moving components. Without the protective layer that oil provides, the heat created from friction would melt an engine’s parts together. As oil runs through your vehicle’s system, it also collects sludge, grime, and other contaminants that can harm the engine. In turn, the oil filter catches these contaminants and helps to prevent them from mixing with the oil. However, the filter can only hold so much. Over time, the small bits and miscellaneous muck will break down the filter’s defenses. When this happens, the result is dirty oil. In addition to being less effective overall, dirty oil can cause permanent damage to some parts of your vehicle. As such, oil and filter changes are considered an important part of vehicle maintenance.`,

Because they are located on the outside of your vehicle, wiper blades are prone to wear and will require replacements in time. Even if they are not heavily used, the blades should be replaced regularly because the material they are made of has its own lifespan. Generally, it is recommended that wiper blades be replaced every 6,000 miles or every six months.

Tire rotations are performed periodically so that all four tires wear evenly. If you do not rotate your tires they will wear unevenly and will require replacement more frequently. Proper inflation of your tires is essential for proper wear and performance. Properly inflated tires also improve fuel mileage.
            
            Chassis Bolts and Nuts – During the 30,000 Mile Service Interval we thoroughly inspect the chassis and suspension for irregular wear and loose components. Most vehicles are driven 15,000 miles per year on average so this is an important safety check that is performed once a year. Preventative Maintenance saves you money because potential issues are caught early and keeps repairs at a minimum.
            
            Exhaust Pipes and Mountings – Leaks in the Exhaust System can not only be noisy but also dangerous. Your Vehicles Exhaust System has dangerous fumes than need to be properly expelled away from the passenger compartment. Leaks or restrictions in the Vehicles Exhaust System can also cause performance problems. An Exhaust System that is not operating as designed can dramatically reduce your power from the engine and restrict your fuel economy. Periodic inspections of manifolds, seals, gaskets, catalytic convertors, and pipes will ensure the safety of you and your family and keep your vehicle running as designed.
            
            Transmission Fluid – Depending on the year, make, and model of your vehicle the Transmission Fluid may need to be replaced at this Service Interval. Vehicle Manufacturers are installing longer life Transmission Fluids and some systems are sealed and do not have a dipstick any more to check the fluid level. Every 30,000 miles we thoroughly check for Transmission Fluid leaks, condition of fluid, and the level of the Transmission Fluid. If a leak develops and the level becomes low the fluid will begin to burn and can cause internal bearing failure. Over time even extended life Transmission Fluid will become discolored and loose some of its protective capabilities and should be replaced. Periodic inspection of the Transmission Fluid level and condition is vital to maintaining your vehicle. If the Transmission Fluid is not properly maintained it will become discolored and can cause major internal Transmission failure. A Transmission Repair or Replacement can cost several thousand dollars and vehicle could be out of service for an extended period of time. Proper Preventative Maintenance of the Transmission fluid will save you time and the high price of a major Transmission Repair. Fuel Lines, Connections and Vapor Recovery System – The fuel that you use in your vehicle is what powers it. Periodic inspection of the Fuel System is necessary for your safety. A fuel leak can be an expensive repair but can also be dangerous. Raw fuel and its vapors before being burned in the engine can cause a fire. It is important to ensure that the fuel connections and lines are properly sealed and maintained. Periodic maintenance will help find potential problems and find issues earlier and can save the cost of a major repair if caught early.
            
            Power Steering Fluid – Most vehicles on the road today have a Hydraulic Power Steering System. The fluid in the Power Steering System can also break down over time. Condensation and moisture in the Power Steering Fluid can cause seal failure and cause internal damage to the Power Steering Rack. Periodic inspections of the Power Steering Fluid level and condition can save the cost of an expensive repair. If the Power Steering Fluid becomes low due to a leak the Power Steering Rack can overheat and cause internal damage. A Power Steering Rack can cost several Thousands of dollars to replace and place the vehicle out of service for several days. Proper Preventative Maintenance of the Power Steering Fluid can save thousands of dollars and an untimely repair.
            
            Brake Lines and Fluid – Properly maintaining your vehicles Brake Fluid level is essential for the safety of you and your family. When you place your foot on the Brake Pedal of your vehicle a properly sealed and maintained Brake System will apply pressure to the Brake Calipers and bring the Brake Pad into contact with the Brake Rotor and properly stop your vehicle. Over time as your Brake Pads wear your Brake Fluid may need to be topped off. Periodic inspections of the Brake Fluid, Brake Lines, and connections will ensure that the Brake System does not loose pressure and fail. If a vehicle’s Brake Fluid becomes too low and there is not enough pressure in the system Brake Failure can occur. Moisture can also build up over time in the Brake Fluid and periodically should be replaced. Moisture in the Brake Fluid can cause damage to the seals and eventually cause a leak. Periodic inspection of your Brake System is essential for your safety and the safety of others.
            
            Four Wheel Drive & All Wheel Drive Systems - If your vehicle is equipped with Four Wheel Drive or All Wheel Drive, the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid may need to be replaced periodically. The Gear Oil in the Transfer Case, Front Differential, and Rear Differential lubricates the bearings. With Time, Use, and Wear of these systems the Gear Oil will start to break down. Periodic inspections of the seals and Gear Oil level will prevent an expensive repair and extensive down time. Just like the vehicles Transmission there are a lot of bearing and metal on metal movements. It is essential for the Dependability and Longevity of your Drivetrain to keep the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid clean and at its proper level. Spark Plugs – Spark Plugs deliver a spark that ignites the fuel in the engine. They need to be replaced periodically. A failed Spark Plug can cause a misfire in the engine. Misfires in the engine can cause raw fuel to not burn in the cylinder and be expelled through the Exhaust System. Continual raw fuel being expelled through the Exhaust System can cause damage to the Catalytic Converter. Periodically replacing your Sparks Plugs not only increase your fuel mileage and performance but it can also save the time and cost of a several thousand dollar repair.

            Engine Coolant – Your vehicle’s engine coolant is one of the vital fluids that are important to maintaining the engine. Most vehicles require that the Engine Coolant be replaced every 30,000 miles. Vehicle Manufacturers consider College Park, MD to be rated as a harsh driving area. Manufacturers are upgrading to longer lasting Engine Coolant. Even though they are starting to install Extended Life Coolant it is still extremely important to periodically check on the condition and level of the Engine Coolant. Even Extended Life Coolant breaks down over time. Ensuring that your vehicle’s Coolant System is maintained at its proper level and free from leaks will make the Coolant last longer and perform at its proper level.
            
            Replace Engine Oil and Filter – Due to the climate in the College Park, MD area Vehicle Manufacturers consider us to be in harsh driving conditions. They require more frequent Oil and Filter changes. Routinely changing your vehicle’s engine oil per the manufacture’s guidelines is an essential part of properly maintaining your vehicle and keeping the warranty intact. The oil keeps the internal components of the engine lubricated and the filter collects any debris preventing it from damage. This is an essential routine maintenance item to ensure performance and longevity of your vehicle.
            
            Steering Linkage and Boots - We inspect the Linkage and Boots in your Steering. Excessive play in your steering can be dangerous. It can inhibit the speed of your response in an emergency situation and cause issues like excessive tire wear.
            
            Drive Shaft Boots – We ensure that your vehicles Boots are properly sealed, do not have any damage or tears, and are not dry rotted. This ensures that the drive shafts stay properly lubricated and can save an expensive repair of replacing the Drive Shaft.
            
            Ball Joints and Dust Covers - Excessive play from the Ball Joints can cause excessive tire wear, poor performance and handling. If not caught early enough can result in failure, cause further suspension damage and leave you stranded on the side of the road.

            Brake Linkage/Drums/Pads/Disc – It is extremely important to keep your vehicle running at its top performance when driving in the College Park, MD area and wherever the road takes you, for the safety of you and your family. A properly working Braking System is essential. Routine and thorough inspections of your braking system will ensure that you are able to safely stop your vehicle each and every time. Brake failures also can cost a lot of money to repair. A brake pad that is getting too low and not able to make it to the next Service Interval if not caught can wear into your Rotor and become a very expensive repair.
            
            Reset Maintenance Reminder - If your vehicle is equipped with a Maintenance Reminder System we will reset that during your service to ensure you are properly notified for your next Service Interval.
            
            Cabin Air Filter and Engine Air Filters – Air Filters are sometimes able to be cleaned. They also need to be replaced periodically. The Engine Air filter keeps debris out of the engine and ensures proper air intake through your engine. Depending where you live in the College Park, MD area your Air Filter might need to be replaced more frequently. If your Engine Air Filter is clogged it will dramatically reduce the engine’s performance and fuel mileage. Cabin Air Filters are also important to maintain. This filters the air in the passenger compartment. Keeping the Cabin Air filter clean is important to ensure that you and your family are breathing clean air. Failure to keep this clean and debris free can also cause stress on the vehicle ventilation system. This can cause a foul smell and undue stress to the vehicles blower motor and ventilation system.
            
            Chassis Bolts and Nuts – During the 30,000 Mile Service Interval we thoroughly inspect the chassis and suspension for irregular wear and loose components. Most vehicles are driven 15,000 miles per year on average so this is an important safety check that is performed once a year. Preventative Maintenance saves you money because potential issues are caught early and keeps repairs at a minimum. Tire Inspection, Rotation, and Inflation – The roads in the Greenbelt, MD area sometimes are not always in the best condition. Proper Tire inflation is vital for optimal handling and safety. During each Service Interval our Mechanics will inspect your tires to ensure proper placement for the best performance and longevity of your tires. Tire rotations are performed periodically so that all four tires wear evenly. If you do not rotate your tires they will wear unevenly and will require replacement more frequently. Proper inflation of your tires is essential for proper wear and performance. Properly inflated tires also improve fuel mileage.
            
            Exhaust Pipes and Mountings – Leaks in the Exhaust System can not only be noisy but also dangerous. Your Vehicles Exhaust System has dangerous fumes than need to be properly expelled away from the passenger compartment. Leaks or restrictions in the Vehicles Exhaust System can also cause performance problems. An Exhaust System that is not operating as designed can dramatically reduce your power from the engine and restrict your fuel economy. Periodic inspections of manifolds, seals, gaskets, catalytic convertors, and pipes will ensure the safety of you and your family and keep your vehicle running as designed.
            
            Fuel Lines, Connections and Vapor Recovery System – The fuel that you use in your vehicle is what powers it. Periodic inspection of the Fuel System is necessary for your safety. A fuel leak can be an expensive repair but can also be dangerous. Raw fuel and its vapors before being burned in the engine can cause a fire. It is important to ensure that the fuel connections and lines are properly sealed and maintained. Periodic maintenance will help find potential problems and find issues earlier and can save the cost of a major repair if caught early.
            
            Transmission Fluid – Depending on the year, make, and model of your vehicle the Transmission Fluid may need to be replaced at this Service Interval. Vehicle Manufacturers are installing longer life Transmission Fluids and some systems are sealed and do not have a dipstick any more to check the fluid level. Every 30,000 miles we thoroughly check for Transmission Fluid leaks, condition of fluid, and the level of the Transmission Fluid. If a leak develops and the level becomes low the fluid will begin to burn and can cause internal bearing failure. Over time even extended life Transmission Fluid will become discolored and loose some of its protective capabilities and should be replaced. Periodic inspection of the Transmission Fluid level and condition is vital to maintaining your vehicle. If the Transmission Fluid is not properly maintained it will become discolored and can cause major internal Transmission failure. A Transmission Repair or Replacement can cost several thousand dollars and vehicle could be out of service for an extended period of time. Proper Preventative Maintenance of the Transmission fluid will save you time and the high price of a major Transmission Repair.
            
            Brake Lines and Fluid – Properly maintaining your vehicles Brake Fluid level is essential for the safety of you and your family. When you place your foot on the Brake Pedal of your vehicle a properly sealed and maintained Brake System will apply pressure to the Brake Calipers and bring the Brake Pad into contact with the Brake Rotor and properly stop your vehicle. Over time as your Brake Pads wear your Brake Fluid may need to be topped off. Periodic inspections of the Brake Fluid, Brake Lines, and connections will ensure that the Brake System does not loose pressure and fail. If a vehicle’s Brake Fluid becomes too low and there is not enough pressure in the system Brake Failure can occur. Moisture can also build up over time in the Brake Fluid and periodically should be replaced. Moisture in the Brake Fluid can cause damage to the seals and eventually cause a leak. Periodic inspection of your Brake System is essential for your safety and the safety of others.
            
            Power Steering Fluid – Most vehicles on the road today have a Hydraulic Power Steering System. The fluid in the Power Steering System can also break down over time. Condensation and moisture in the Power Steering Fluid can cause seal failure and cause internal damage to the Power Steering Rack. Periodic inspections of the Power Steering Fluid level and condition can save the cost of an expensive repair. If the Power Steering Fluid becomes low due to a leak the Power Steering Rack can overheat and cause internal damage. A Power Steering Rack can cost several Thousands of dollars to replace and place the vehicle out of service for several days. Proper Preventative Maintenance of the Power Steering Fluid can save thousands of dollars and an untimely repair.
            
            Spark Plugs – Spark Plugs deliver a spark that ignites the fuel in the engine. They need to be replaced periodically. A failed Spark Plug can cause a misfire in the engine. Misfires in the engine can cause raw fuel to not burn in the cylinder and be expelled through the Exhaust System. Continual raw fuel being expelled through the Exhaust System can cause damage to the Catalytic Converter. Periodically replacing your Sparks Plugs not only increase your fuel mileage and performance but it can also save the time and cost of a several thousand dollar repair.
            
            Four Wheel Drive & All Wheel Drive Systems - If your vehicle is equipped with Four Wheel Drive or All Wheel Drive, the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid may need to be replaced periodically. The Gear Oil in the Transfer Case, Front Differential, and Rear Differential lubricates the bearings. With Time, Use, and Wear of these systems the Gear Oil will start to break down. Periodic inspections of the seals and Gear Oil level will prevent an expensive repair and extensive down time. Just like the vehicles Transmission there are a lot of bearing and metal on metal movements. It is essential for the Dependability and Longevity of your Drivetrain to keep the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid clean and at its proper level.
            
            There is more to servicing your vehicle than just changing your oil and rotating your tires. Proper Preventative Maintenance will save you money and also your time.

Our 15,000 mile Service Interval consist of the following services:
            
            Replace Engine Oil and Filter – Due to the climate in the College Park, MD area Vehicle Manufacturers consider us to be in harsh driving conditions. They require more frequent Oil and Filter changes. Routinely changing your vehicle’s engine oil per the manufacture’s guidelines is an essential part of properly maintaining your vehicle and keeping the warranty intact. The oil keeps the internal components of the engine lubricated and the filter collects any debris preventing it from damage. This is an essential routine maintenance item to ensure performance and longevity of your vehicle.
            
            Steering Linkage and Boots - We inspect the Linkage and Boots in your Steering. Excessive play in your steering can be dangerous. It can inhibit the speed of your response in an emergency situation and cause issues like excessive tire wear.
            
            Drive Shaft Boots – We ensure that your vehicles Boots are properly sealed, do not have any damage or tears, and are not dry rotted. This ensures that the drive shafts stay properly lubricated and can save an expensive repair of replacing the Drive Shaft.
            
            Engine Coolant – Your vehicle’s engine coolant is one of the vital fluids that are important to maintaining the engine. Most vehicles require that the Engine Coolant be replaced every 30,000 miles. Vehicle Manufacturers consider College Park, MD to be rated as a harsh driving area. Manufacturers are upgrading to longer lasting Engine Coolant. Even though they are starting to install Extended Life Coolant it is still extremely important to periodically check on the condition and level of the Engine Coolant. Even Extended Life Coolant breaks down over time. Ensuring that your vehicle’s Coolant System is maintained at its proper level and free from leaks will make the Coolant last longer and perform at its proper level.
            
            Brake Linkage/Drums/Pads/Disc – It is extremely important to keep your vehicle running at its top performance when driving in the College Park, MD area and wherever the road takes you, for the safety of you and your family. A properly working Braking System is essential. Routine and thorough inspections of your braking system will ensure that you are able to safely stop your vehicle each and every time.

            Reset Maintenance Reminder - If your vehicle is equipped with a Maintenance Reminder System we will reset that during your service to ensure you are properly notified for your next Service Interval.
            
            Ball Joints and Dust Covers - Excessive play from the Ball Joints can cause excessive tire wear, poor performance and handling. If not caught early enough can result in failure, cause further suspension damage and leave you stranded on the side of the road. Ensuring that there is no excessive play from the suspension can save the cost of a very expensive repair and prevent a break down.
            
            Chassis Bolts and Nuts – During the 30,000 Mile Service Interval we thoroughly inspect the chassis and suspension for irregular wear and loose components. Most vehicles are driven 15,000 miles per year on average so this is an important safety check that is performed once a year. Preventative Maintenance saves you money because potential issues are caught early and keeps repairs at a minimum.
            
            Tire Inspection, Rotation, and Inflation – The roads in the Greenbelt, MD area sometimes are not always in the best condition. Proper Tire inflation is vital for optimal handling and safety. During each Service Interval our Mechanics will inspect your tires to ensure proper placement for the best performance and longevity of your tires. Tire rotations are performed periodically so that all four tires wear evenly. If you do not rotate your tires they will wear unevenly and will require replacement more frequently. Proper inflation of your tires is essential for proper wear and performance. Properly inflated tires also improve fuel mileage.
            
            Cabin Air Filter and Engine Air Filters – Air Filters are sometimes able to be cleaned. They also need to be replaced periodically. The Engine Air filter keeps debris out of the engine and ensures proper air intake through your engine. Depending where you live in the College Park, MD area your Air Filter might need to be replaced more frequently.If your Engine Air Filter is clogged it will dramatically reduce the engine’s performance and fuel mileage. Cabin Air Filters are also important to maintain. This filters the air in the passenger compartment. Keeping the Cabin Air filter clean is important to ensure that you and your family are breathing clean air. Failure to keep this clean and debris free can also cause stress on the vehicle ventilation system. This can cause a foul smell and undue stress to the vehicles blower motor and ventilation system.
            
            Fuel Lines, Connections and Vapor Recovery System – The fuel that you use in your vehicle is what powers it. Periodic inspection of the Fuel System is necessary for your safety. A fuel leak can be an expensive repair but can also be dangerous. Raw fuel and its vapors before being burned in the engine can cause a fire. It is important to ensure that the fuel connections and lines are properly sealed and maintained. Periodic maintenance will help find potential problems and find issues earlier and can save the cost of a major repair if caught early.
            
            Transmission Fluid – Depending on the year, make, and model of your vehicle the Transmission Fluid may need to be replaced at this Service Interval. Vehicle Manufacturers are installing longer life Transmission Fluids and some systems are sealed and do not have a dipstick any more to inspect the fluid level. Every 30,000 miles we thoroughly check for Transmission Fluid leaks, condition of fluid, and the level of the Transmission Fluid. If a leak develops and the level becomes low the fluid will begin to burn and can cause internal bearing failure. Over time even extended life Transmission Fluid will become discolored and loose some of its protective capabilities and should be replaced. Periodic inspection of the Transmission Fluid level and condition is vital to maintaining your vehicle. If the Transmission Fluid is not properly maintained it will become discolored and can cause major internal Transmission failure. A Transmission Repair or Replacement can cost several thousand dollars and vehicle could be out of service for an extended period of time. Proper Preventative Maintenance of the Transmission fluid will save you time and the high price of a major Transmission Repair. Exhaust Pipes and Mountings – Leaks in the Exhaust System can not only be noisy but also dangerous. Your Vehicles Exhaust System has dangerous fumes than need to be properly expelled away from the passenger compartment. Leaks or restrictions in the Vehicles Exhaust System can also cause performance problems. An Exhaust System that is not operating as designed can dramatically reduce your power from the engine and restrict your fuel economy. Periodic inspections of manifolds, seals, gaskets, catalytic convertors, and pipes will ensure the safety of you and your family and keep your vehicle running as designed.
            
            Brake Lines and Fluid – Properly maintaining your vehicles Brake Fluid level is essential for the safety of you and your family. When you place your foot on the Brake Pedal of your vehicle a properly sealed and maintained Brake System will apply pressure to the Brake Calipers and bring the Brake Pad into contact with the Brake Rotor and properly stop your vehicle. Over time as your Brake Pads wear your Brake Fluid may need to be topped off. Periodic inspections of the Brake Fluid, Brake Lines, and connections will ensure that the Brake System does not loose pressure and fail. If a vehicle’s Brake Fluid becomes too low and there is not enough pressure in the system Brake Failure can occur. Moisture can also build up over time in the Brake Fluid and periodically should be replaced. Moisture in the Brake Fluid can cause damage to the seals and eventually cause a leak. Periodic evaluations of your Brake System is essential for your safety and the safety of others.
            
            Spark Plugs – Spark Plugs deliver a spark that ignites the fuel in the engine. They need to be replaced periodically. A failed Spark Plug can cause a misfire in the engine. Misfires in the engine can cause raw fuel to not burn in the cylinder and be expelled through the Exhaust System. Continual raw fuel being expelled through the Exhaust System can cause damage to the Catalytic Converter. Periodically replacing your Sparks Plugs not only increase your fuel mileage and performance but it can also save the time and cost of a several thousand dollar repair.
            
            Four Wheel Drive & All Wheel Drive Systems - If your vehicle is equipped with Four Wheel Drive or All Wheel Drive, the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid may need to be replaced periodically. The Gear Oil in the Transfer Case, Front Differential, and Rear Differential lubricates the bearings. With Time, Use, and Wear of these systems the Gear Oil will start to break down. Periodic inspections of the seals and Gear Oil level will prevent an expensive repair and extensive down time. Just like the vehicles Transmission there are a lot of bearing and metal on metal movements. It is essential for the Dependability and Longevity of your Drivetrain to keep the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid clean and at its proper level.
            
            Power Steering Fluid – Most vehicles on the road today have a Hydraulic Power Steering System. The fluid in the Power Steering System can also break down over time. Condensation and moisture in the Power Steering Fluid can cause seal failure and cause internal damage to the Power Steering Rack. Periodic inspections of the Power Steering Fluid level and condition can save the cost of an expensive repair. If the Power Steering Fluid becomes low due to a leak the Power Steering Rack can overheat and cause internal damage. A Power Steering Rack can cost several Thousands of dollars to replace and place the vehicle out of service for several days. Proper Preventative Maintenance of the Power Steering Fluid can save thousands of dollars and an untimely repair.

            Tire Inspection, Rotation, and Inflation – The roads in the Greenbelt, MD area sometimes are not always in the best condition. Proper Tire inflation is vital for optimal handling and safety. During each Service Interval our Mechanics will inspect your tires to ensure proper placement for the best performance and longevity of your tires. Tire rotations are performed periodically so that all four tires wear evenly. If you do not rotate your tires they will wear unevenly and will require replacement more frequently. Proper inflation of your tires is essential for proper wear and performance. Properly inflated tires also improve fuel mileage.
            
            Drive Shaft Boots – We ensure that your vehicles Boots are properly sealed, do not have any damage or tears, and are not dry rotted. This ensures that the drive shafts stay properly lubricated and can save an expensive repair of replacing the Drive Shaft.

            Engine Coolant – Your vehicle’s engine coolant is one of the vital fluids that are important to maintaining the engine. Most vehicles require that the Engine Coolant be replaced every 30,000 miles. Vehicle Manufacturers consider College Park, MD to be rated as a harsh driving area. Manufacturers are upgrading to longer lasting Engine Coolant. Even though they are starting to install Extended Life Coolant it is still extremely important to periodically check on the condition and level of the Engine Coolant. Even Extended Life Coolant breaks down over time. Ensuring that your vehicle’s Coolant System is maintained at its proper level and free from leaks will make the Coolant last longer and perform at its proper level.
            
            Chassis Bolts and Nuts – During the 30,000 Mile Service Interval we thoroughly inspect the chassis and suspension for irregular wear and loose components. Most vehicles are driven 15,000 miles per year on average so this is an important safety check that is performed once a year. Preventative Maintenance saves you money because potential issues are caught early and keeps repairs at a minimum.
            
            Tire Inspection, Rotation, and Inflation – The roads in the Greenbelt, MD area sometimes are not always in the best condition. Proper Tire inflation is vital for optimal handling and safety. During each Service Interval our Mechanics will inspect your tires to ensure proper placement for the best performance and longevity of your tires. Tire rotations are performed periodically so that all four tires wear evenly. If you do not rotate your tires they will wear unevenly and will require replacement more frequently.

If not caught early enough can result in failure, cause further suspension damage and leave you stranded on the side of the road. Ensuring that there is no excessive play from the suspension can save the cost of a very expensive repair and prevent a break down.
            
            Cabin Air Filter and Engine Air Filters – Air Filters are sometimes able to be cleaned. They also need to be replaced periodically. The Engine Air filter keeps debris out of the engine and ensures proper air intake through your engine. Depending where you live in the College Park, MD area your Air Filter might need to be replaced more frequently. If your Engine Air Filter is clogged it will dramatically reduce the engine’s performance and fuel mileage. Cabin Air Filters are also important to maintain. This filters the air in the passenger compartment. Keeping the Cabin Air filter clean is important to ensure that you and your family are breathing clean air. Failure to keep this clean and debris free can also cause stress on the vehicle ventilation system. This can cause a foul smell and undue stress to the vehicles blower motor and ventilation system.
            
            Transmission Fluid – Depending on the year, make, and model of your vehicle the Transmission Fluid may need to be replaced at this Service Interval. Vehicle Manufacturers are installing longer life Transmission Fluids and some systems are sealed and do not have a dipstick any more to inspect the fluid level. Every 30,000 miles we thoroughly check for Transmission Fluid leaks, condition of fluid, and the level of the Transmission Fluid. If a leak develops and the level becomes low the fluid will begin to burn and can cause internal bearing failure. Over time even extended life Transmission Fluid will become discolored and loose some of its protective capabilities and should be replaced. Periodic inspection of the Transmission Fluid level and condition is vital to maintaining your vehicle. If the Transmission Fluid is not properly maintained it will become discolored and can cause major internal Transmission failure. A Transmission Repair or Replacement can cost several thousand dollars and vehicle could be out of service for an extended period of time. Proper Preventative Maintenance of the Transmission fluid will save you time and the high price of a major Transmission Repair.
            
            Exhaust Pipes and Mountings – Leaks in the Exhaust System can not only be noisy but also dangerous. Your Vehicles Exhaust System has dangerous fumes than need to be properly expelled away from the passenger compartment. Leaks or restrictions in the Vehicles Exhaust System can also cause performance problems. An Exhaust System that is not operating as designed can dramatically reduce your power from the engine and restrict your fuel economy. Periodic inspections of manifolds, seals, gaskets, catalytic convertors, and pipes will ensure the safety of you and your family and keep your vehicle running as designed.
            
            Fuel Lines, Connections and Vapor Recovery System – The fuel that you use in your vehicle is what powers it. Periodic inspection of the Fuel System is necessary for your safety. A fuel leak can be an expensive repair but can also be dangerous. Raw fuel and its vapors before being burned in the engine can cause a fire. It is important to ensure that the fuel connections and lines are properly sealed and maintained. Periodic maintenance will help find potential problems and find issues earlier and can save the cost of a major repair if caught early.
            
            Spark Plugs – Spark Plugs deliver a spark that ignites the fuel in the engine. They need to be replaced periodically. A failed Spark Plug can cause a misfire in the engine. Misfires in the engine can cause raw fuel to not burn in the cylinder and be expelled through the Exhaust System. Continual raw fuel being expelled through the Exhaust System can cause damage to the Catalytic Converter. Periodically replacing your Sparks Plugs not only increase your fuel mileage and performance but it can also save the time and cost of a several thousand dollar repair.
            
            Four Wheel Drive & All Wheel Drive Systems - If your vehicle is equipped with Four Wheel Drive or All Wheel Drive, the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid may need to be replaced periodically. The Gear Oil in the Transfer Case, Front Differential, and Rear Differential lubricates the bearings. With Time, Use, and Wear of these systems the Gear Oil will start to break down. Periodic inspections of the seals and Gear Oil level will prevent an expensive repair and extensive down time. Just like the vehicles Transmission there are a lot of bearing and metal on metal movements. It is essential for the Dependability and Longevity of your Drivetrain to keep the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid clean and at its proper level.
            
            Brake Lines and Fluid – Properly maintaining your vehicles Brake Fluid level is essential for the safety of you and your family. When you place your foot on the Brake Pedal of your vehicle a properly sealed and maintained Brake System will apply pressure to the Brake Calipers and bring the Brake Pad into contact with the Brake Rotor and properly stop your vehicle. Over time as your Brake Pads wear your Brake Fluid may need to be topped off. Periodic inspections of the Brake Fluid, Brake Lines, and connections will ensure that the Brake System does not loose pressure and fail. If a vehicle’s Brake Fluid becomes too low and there is not enough pressure in the system Brake Failure can occur. Moisture can also build up over time in the Brake Fluid and periodically should be replaced. Moisture in the Brake Fluid can cause damage to the seals and eventually cause a leak. Periodic inspection of your Brake System is essential for your safety and the safety of others.
            
            Power Steering Fluid – Most vehicles on the road today have a Hydraulic Power Steering System. The fluid in the Power Steering System can also break down over time. Condensation and moisture in the Power Steering Fluid can cause seal failure and cause internal damage to the Power Steering Rack. Periodic inspections of the Power Steering Fluid level and condition can save the cost of an expensive repair. If the Power Steering Fluid becomes low due to a leak the Power Steering Rack can overheat and cause internal damage. A Power Steering Rack can cost several Thousands of dollars to replace and place the vehicle out of service for several days. Proper Preventative Maintenance of the Power Steering Fluid can save thousands of dollars and an untimely repair.

            Transmission Fluid – Depending on the year, make, and model of your vehicle the Transmission Fluid may need to be replaced at this Service Interval. Vehicle Manufacturers are installing longer life Transmission Fluids and some systems are sealed and do not have a dipstick any more to inspect the fluid level. Every 30,000 miles we thoroughly check for Transmission Fluid leaks, condition of fluid, and the level of the Transmission Fluid. If a leak develops and the level becomes low the fluid will begin to burn and can cause internal bearing failure. Over time even extended life Transmission Fluid will become discolored and loose some of its protective capabilities and should be replaced. Periodic inspection of the Transmission Fluid level and condition is vital to maintaining your vehicle. If the Transmission Fluid is not properly maintained it will become discolored and can cause major internal Transmission failure. A Transmission Repair or Replacement can cost several thousand dollars and vehicle could be out of service for an extended period of time. Proper Preventative Maintenance of the Transmission fluid will save you time and the high price of a major Transmission Repair.
            
            Fuel Lines, Connections and Vapor Recovery System – The fuel that you use in your vehicle is what powers it. Periodic inspection of the Fuel System is necessary for your safety.

It is important to ensure that the fuel connections and lines are properly sealed and maintained. Periodic maintenance will help find potential problems and find issues earlier and can save the cost of a major repair if caught early. Exhaust Pipes and Mountings – Leaks in the Exhaust System can not only be noisy but also dangerous. Your Vehicles Exhaust System has dangerous fumes than need to be properly expelled away from the passenger compartment. Leaks or restrictions in the Vehicles Exhaust System can also cause performance problems. An Exhaust System that is not operating as designed can dramatically reduce your power from the engine and restrict your fuel economy. Periodic inspections of manifolds, seals, gaskets, catalytic convertors, and pipes will ensure the safety of you and your family and keep your vehicle running as designed.
            
            Spark Plugs – Spark Plugs deliver a spark that ignites the fuel in the engine. They need to be replaced periodically. A failed Spark Plug can cause a misfire in the engine. Misfires in the engine can cause raw fuel to not burn in the cylinder and be expelled through the Exhaust System. Continual raw fuel being expelled through the Exhaust System can cause damage to the Catalytic Converter. Periodically replacing your Sparks Plugs not only increase your fuel mileage and performance but it can also save the time and cost of a several thousand dollar repair.
            
            Four Wheel Drive & All Wheel Drive Systems - If your vehicle is equipped with Four Wheel Drive or All Wheel Drive, the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid may need to be replaced periodically. The Gear Oil in the Transfer Case, Front Differential, and Rear Differential lubricates the bearings. With Time, Use, and Wear of these systems the Gear Oil will start to break down. Periodic inspections of the seals and Gear Oil level will prevent an expensive repair and extensive down time. Just like the vehicles Transmission there are a lot of bearing and metal on metal movements. It is essential for the Dependability and Longevity of your Drivetrain to keep the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid clean and at its proper level.
            
            Power Steering Fluid – Most vehicles on the road today have a Hydraulic Power Steering System. The fluid in the Power Steering System can also break down over time. Condensation and moisture in the Power Steering Fluid can cause seal failure and cause internal damage to the Power Steering Rack. Periodic inspections of the Power Steering Fluid level and condition can save the cost of an expensive repair. If the Power Steering Fluid becomes low due to a leak the Power Steering Rack can overheat and cause internal damage. A Power Steering Rack can cost several Thousands of dollars to replace and place the vehicle out of service for several days. Proper Preventative Maintenance of the Power Steering Fluid can save thousands of dollars and an untimely repair.
            
            Brake Lines and Fluid – Properly maintaining your vehicles Brake Fluid level is essential for the safety of you and your family. When you place your foot on the Brake Pedal of your vehicle a properly sealed and maintained Brake System will apply pressure to the Brake Calipers and bring the Brake Pad into contact with the Brake Rotor and properly stop your vehicle. Over time as your Brake Pads wear your Brake Fluid may need to be topped off. Periodic inspections of the Brake Fluid, Brake Lines, and connections will ensure that the Brake System does not loose pressure and fail. If a vehicle’s Brake Fluid becomes too low and there is not enough pressure in the system Brake Failure can occur. Moisture can also build up over time in the Brake Fluid and periodically should be replaced. Moisture in the Brake Fluid can cause damage to the seals and eventually cause a leak. Periodic inspection of your Brake System is essential for your safety and the safety of others.

Vehicle Manufacturers are installing longer life Transmission Fluids and some systems are sealed and do not have a dipstick any more to inspect the fluid level. Every 30,000 miles we thoroughly check for Transmission Fluid leaks, condition of fluid, and the level of the Transmission Fluid. If a leak develops and the level becomes low the fluid will begin to burn and can cause internal bearing failure. Over time even extended life Transmission Fluid will become discolored and loose some of its protective capabilities and should be replaced. Periodic inspection of the Transmission Fluid level and condition is vital to maintaining your vehicle. If the Transmission Fluid is not properly maintained it will become discolored and can cause major internal Transmission failure. A Transmission Repair or Replacement can cost several thousand dollars and vehicle could be out of service for an extended period of time. Proper Preventative Maintenance of the Transmission fluid will save you time and the high price of a major Transmission Repair.
            
            Fuel Lines, Connections and Vapor Recovery System – The fuel that you use in your vehicle is what powers it. Periodic inspection of the Fuel System is necessary for your safety. A fuel leak can be an expensive repair but can also be dangerous. Raw fuel and its vapors before being burned in the engine can cause a fire. It is important to ensure that the fuel connections and lines are properly sealed and maintained.

            Spark Plugs – Spark Plugs deliver a spark that ignites the fuel in the engine. They need to be replaced periodically. A faulty Spark Plug can cause a misfire in the engine. Misfires in the engine can cause raw fuel to not burn in the cylinder and be expelled through the Exhaust System. Continual raw fuel being expelled through the Exhaust System can cause damage to the Catalytic Converter. Periodically replacing your Spark Plugs not only increase your fuel mileage and performance but it can also save the time and cost of a several thousand dollar repair.
            
            Four Wheel Drive & All Wheel Drive Systems - If your vehicle is equipped with Four Wheel Drive or All Wheel Drive, the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid may need to be replaced periodically. The Gear Oil in the Transfer Case, Front Differential, and Rear Differential lubricates the bearings. With Time, Use, and Wear of these systems the Gear Oil will start to break down. Periodic inspections of the seals and Gear Oil level will prevent an expensive repair and extensive down time. Just like the vehicles Transmission there are a lot of bearing and metal on metal movements. It is essential for the Dependability and Longevity of your Drivetrain to keep the Transfer Case Fluid, Front Differential Fluid, and Rear Differential Fluid clean and at its proper level.
            
            Exhaust Pipes and Mountings – Leaks in the Exhaust System can not only be noisy but also dangerous. Your Vehicles Exhaust System has dangerous fumes than need to be properly expelled away from the passenger compartment.

        desc1: `Your vehicle’s starting and charging system is involved in regulating multiple electrical processes to start your vehicle's engine and keep it running. The starting system consists of the battery, a starter motor, and a starter solenoid responsible for starting the engine, while the charging system consists of an alternator and voltage regulator. The charging system is responsible for routing energy throughout the entire electrical process while sustaining the battery’s charge. The battery supplies the electric power necessary to start the vehicle. This process starts when you turn the ignition. Then, the starting system sends power from the battery to the starter solenoid to the starter motor, which turns the engine in order to begin the internal combustion process. The alternator powers the other electrical components in your vehicle while the regulator controls the voltage supplied to each component. The regulator also ensures that the alternator maintains the battery’s charge so that the entire cycle can continue.`,

Because the battery is required for the electrical charge needed to start the rest of the electrical system, a weak or dead battery can also prevent your car from starting. If a jump start refuses to revive your battery and the starting system, our staff may need to take a closer look at the other components of the starting and charging system to determine whether or not you need a starter replacement or an alternator replacement. All components within your vehicle’s starting and charging system are necessary to ensure proper working order, and one bad link between them can render the entire electrical process useless.

            desc1: `An alternator is part of a vehicle’s charging system, and is an essential component in keeping a vehicle operable. The alternator works with the battery and voltage regulator to keep electrical components running. Usually located near the front of a vehicle’s engine, an alternator can be identified by its aluminum body, vents, and an internal or external cooling fan. Depending on the vehicle, the alternator pulley is driven by either a serpentine belt or v-belt. This mechanical energy is then converted into electrical energy as internal parts operate to create a magnetic field used to produce the alternating current output. The alternator can reach high temperatures fast, so an operative cooling fan is important. Although the battery can keep the vehicle running for a little while, it will not be able to keep it running for an extended period of time if the alternator malfunctions. In fact, the alternator serves as the charger for the battery as well. Because a bad alternator will eventually render the vehicle inoperable, it is imperative that a driver have this component repaired or replaced as soon as possible.`,

            desc1: `Car batteries are fundamental parts of both the charging and starting systems. Within the starting system, the role of the battery is to send a current of electricity to the starter so that the vehicle is able to start and run. In addition, the battery is responsible for supplying electricity to other electrical components, such as the radio and the internal and external lights when the demand exceeds the supply of the alternator or when the vehicle is off. Most vehicles use one battery, but vehicles with diesel engines, electric vehicles, or vehicles that run a 24-volt system may require two or more batteries to power their engines and electric systems. Currently, the SLI battery is a popular type of battery used in many vehicles. The letters, which stand for starting, lighting, and ignition, indicate the battery’s major functions. Overall, an automotive battery is an essential component in vehicles. Without a working battery, an engine will not start. As such, it is important for a driver to keep watch over battery life.`,

When a driver turns the key to start the engine, the battery sends a small supply of electricity to the starter solenoid. In turn, the solenoid powers the motor which sends a gear to mesh with the ring gear on a vehicle’s flywheel. Depending on the vehicle, the starter may be a direct drive (DD), planetary gear (PLGR), permanent magnet gear reduction (PMGR), permanent magnet direct drive (PMDD), or offset gear reduction (OSGR). In a DD starter, components are attached in a line and run off the armature. A PLGR starter has a shaft that the armature uses and is good at increasing torque. A PMGR starter is similar to a PLGR starter except the PMGR starter uses permanent magnets instead of field coils. Similarly, PMDD starters are akin to DD starters except PMDDs use permanent magnets instead of field coils. Finally, OSGR starters do not run directly off the armature. No matter the type, each starter ultimately plays an essential role in powering a vehicle.`,

The steering and suspension system also helps drivers remain in control of their vehicles at all times. The suspension system converts forward energy created by bumps in the road into vertical energy that travels up into the vehicle frame. Suspension system components, like coil springs and shock absorbers, help to dampen the impact of this road force. While the individual components comprising each suspension system may vary, all suspension system components will weaken over time through stress applied during normal driving conditions. Similarly, off-road driving and erratic driving can wear down suspension components more quickly. Regardless of your driving preferences, we have the necessary equipment to identify and correct any issue plaguing your steering and suspension system. Our staff is trained to inspect the steering and suspension components in order to determine whether your service will entail a minor adjustment or a replacement.`,

Ball joints are ball-and-socket joints located between the control arm and the steering knuckle. Ball joints act as the pivot point between the wheels and the rest of the suspension system. They are designed to allow for movement in two planes at once while providing ease of rotation in those planes. They allow a vehicle’s suspension system to move up or down while the wheels turn left or right. Vehicles with shocks have upper and lower ball joints, while many vehicles with struts have only lower ball joints. Some ball joints are load-bearing and will wear faster than normal ball joints. As an important suspension component, ball joints are designed to experience wear and tear, often in the form of friction. Like all suspension system components, ball joints have a maintenance schedule that can help prevent unexpected repairs or replacements.`,

In extreme cases, a worn ball joint that fails may fall out of its casing and cause a collapse of the suspension system. Clunking sounds, poor handling, and unnatural pulling are all signs of bad ball joints. In some cases, ball joints may require replacements. If you plan on avoiding a ball joint failure, be sure to consult your owner’s manual for the maximum allowable wear on your suspension system’s ball joints.

Modern day shocks are velocity-sensitive, which means that the faster the springs and other suspension components are moving, the more resistance provided by the shocks. Hydraulic shocks convert kinetic energy from the springs into thermal energy that the hydraulic fluid inside each shock absorbs and dissipates. When the suspension system bounces, hydraulic fluid is forced through holes inside the piston. This slows the compression of the piston, thereby slowing down spring and suspension movement.

The bounce test, wherein you bounce on each corner of your vehicle a few times, is a good way to determine whether or not you need to schedule a strut replacement. If your vehicle bounces and settles, your struts are operating as they should. If your vehicle continues to bounce, you should seek to replace the struts on your suspension system as soon as possible. Other signs that your struts need to be replaced include excessive brake dive, acceleration squat, body roll or sway, and unusual tire wear patterns. Unusual noise from struts may also indicate that the spring seat or strut bearing requires a replacement. If you experience any of the above signs of worn struts, contact us immediately. Having your struts replaced will improve braking, handling, and the overall controllability of your vehicle.`,

The suspension system helps your vehicle’s tires maintain firm contact on the road at all times by compensating for bumps, potholes, and sudden undulations. Suspension system components like coil springs, leaf springs, torsion bars, shocks, and struts all help to absorb bounce, shock, and unexpected motion from the surface of the road. Without a fully functioning suspension system, your vehicle will be harder to control. Because regular wear and tear takes its toll on your suspension system, the scheduling of routine repairs and an understanding of the signs of an impending service are an important part of suspension system maintenance. For example, experiencing unusual movements over bumps or through turns are signs that your suspension system should be inspected by a staff of professionals. When you suspect suspension system problems, please give us a call or contact us.`,

The sway bar is charged with controlling “body roll” by distributing the weight of your vehicle to both sides of the suspension. When your vehicle moves through a turn, the sway bar keeps the vehicle level by minimizing body roll through the transfer of vehicle weight to the outside wheels. It also maintains solid contact with the surface of the road through the compression of the suspension components on the inside wheels. Sway bar links are a crucial component in your vehicle’s suspension system. The sway bar links are what connect the suspension to the sway bar and transfer the force of motion from the wheels to the axles. When the vehicle turns or corners, the sway bar end links pull on the bar to resist body roll while stabilizing the force of motion and the weight of the vehicle.`,

While some sway bar links have bushing that can be replaced, other sway bar links require replacements upon wearing out. Warning signs of a broken or bad sway bar link include clunks and squeaks. Over-steering or excessive lean through turns are also symptoms of worn sway bar links, but they can also be signs of larger problems with your vehicle’s suspension system. Do not let symptoms of bad sway bar links or other suspension components go untreated. Little problems with suspension systems have the tendency to turn into larger problems and more expensive repairs if not repaired or replaced.

There are two types of Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems in existence today—Direct and Indirect. A Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring System uses sensors on the inside tire assembly to transmit tire pressure information to your vehicle’s computer. An Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System gauges tire pressure through your vehicle’s Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) by using speed sensors to measure the rotational speed of each wheel (as tire pressure decreases, the rolling distance decreases, and the rotational speed increases). All TPMS systems require regular maintenance in order to meet maximum performance standards, which requires all vehicles to be equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System.`,

There are two types of tire pressure monitoring systems—direct and indirect. A direct TPMS receives information from pressure sensors inside each tire on the vehicle, while an indirect TPMS uses speed sensor data from the wheels to determine tire pressure levels. When a tire has an insufficient level of pressure, it becomes a safety hazard for various reasons. If pressure is too high, tires tend to bounce and lose traction. If pressure is too low, tires heat up quickly and wear out easily. Heat can negatively affect the tread of a tire and ultimately lead to blowouts and accidents. We recommend that drivers pay attention to the Tire Pressure Monitoring System and heed any warnings it produces.`,

            desc1: `There are many hazards that can make tires less effective and more of a danger to drivers and passengers. It is not uncommon for a sharp stone, nail, or other pointed piece of debris to puncture a tire. Because flat tires are dangerous to use, it is advised that motorists only drive on them in extreme circumstances, such as when they need to reach safety from a busy highway. It is also important to note that the longer a driver uses a flat tire, the more unlikely it becomes that a tire repair service can be performed. This is because riding on a flat tire for too long can cause irrevocable damage to the tire. As the tire deflates, the wheel will come into closer contact with the ground, potentially damaging the rim. It is important to understand that tire repair is time sensitive. The sooner you are able to bring a lightly to moderately damaged tire in for repair, the more likely it is that the tire can be saved.`,

The RMA states that a flat tire can be repaired if the puncture is ¼ inch or smaller and if the puncture is located on the tread of a tire. They recommend that the tire repair procedure involve a plug and a patch on the lining of the tire. A plug and a patch can add thousands of miles more to a damaged tire. For a punctured tire, our staff will patch, plug, or seal the damaged area. If your tire is losing air due to valve stem damage or if the tire is not securely attached to the wheel’s rim, our tire repair service staff will be able to help. Ultimately, repairing your tire helps to keep you safe on the road and can save you money in the long run.`,

            desc1: `Our tire rotation service involves changing the position of a vehicle’s tires in order to reduce massive tread differentiation between them. Tires tend to exhibit differing amounts of tread wear, because each tire does not deal with exactly the same types or amounts of stress as its companions. Motorists rotate their tires because this is an effective way to deal with uneven tread wear. By alternating tires according to tire rotation patterns, drivers can help distribute tread wear more evenly and reduce uneven tread wear. Depending upon the type of vehicle a motorist drives and the type of tires on the vehicle, the tire rotation pattern may vary. Rotation experts may exchange the front tires with one-another, switch the rear tires with one-another, or swap the front and rear tires. If the vehicle has a full-size matching spare tire, it may also be included in the rotation cycle.`,

            desc1: `You should rotate your tires to prevent uneven tread wear. Uneven tread commonly occurs because most vehicles do not distribute weight evenly between the front and rear tires. In general, front tires tend to deteriorate more quickly than rear tires due to their location and the weight of a vehicle’s engine. By rotating your tires, you’ll distribute the wear more evenly, and you won’t need to replace your tires as frequently. Beyond the benefit of extended tread life, routine and professional tire rotation services can also improve your gas mileage. This is because well-maintained tires reduce rolling resistance, which affects your vehicle’s performance and gas mileage. Our tire rotation service can help prevent massive tread differentiation between tires, encourage better vehicular performance, and save you money by contributing to better gas mileage. If you have questions about how often you should rotate your tires, simply ask a member of our service staff.`,

For each of our vehicle inspectors, the main priority is to ensure that the vehicle is both well-maintained and equipped for highway use. All of our vehicle inspections are performed in complete compliance with the regulations set forth by governing parties, and we may provide drivers with a full checklist of approved items after the service is complete.`,

Because vehicles are a major source of pollution, many areas are trying to cut down on pollution as much as possible by requiring emissions inspections. These inspections help by serving as an effective means of protecting the environment and enhancing air quality. Because emissions inspections are required in many states or provinces, drivers can be fined for riding in a vehicle that either has not had or has failed to pass an emissions inspection. As such, motorists are encouraged to look up the emissions inspection laws of the state or province they reside in or plan to visit an emissions inspection station before they embark on a destination.`,

Because of these profits and the potential for sizable fraudulent claims, many insurance companies require an insurance inspection before issuing an insurance policy on a new or pre-owned vehicle. Insurance inspections mandated by some insurance companies have proven to be a good tool and can help auto insurance companies control their costs and maintain competitive rates. Typically, insurance inspections become mandatory when an insurance company receives a request for coverage for a newly purchased vehicle or when a vehicle changes carriers. The driver seeking to be insured may be provided with a time frame for having the vehicle inspected, as well as a list of authorized insurance inspection facilities. Insurance inspections are designed to assess the physical condition of the vehicle and to prove that the vehicle actually exists.`,

A photo is also taken of the vehicle identification number (VIN) that, depending on the vehicle, may be located a variety of locations. The options and accessories of the vehicle are also inspected and noted. This is most helpful when an insurance claim is submitted to repair a particular component of a vehicle. The insurance company can refer to the insurance inspection and verify that the vehicle was equipped with the particular component at the time the claim was filed. Another part of insurance inspections includes a reading of the mileage on a vehicle’s odometer. The make, model, and year of the vehicle are also noted during an insurance inspection. These inspections can be conducted in a variety of ways, but the essential inspection components are the same.`,

Vehicle safety inspections are a way to ensure that every vehicle on the road is maintained for safe operation. The purpose of state-mandated vehicle inspections is to try to prevent vehicle failure on the highway, which could lead to a crash that may result in injury or death.
